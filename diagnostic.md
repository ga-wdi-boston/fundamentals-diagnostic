## Question 1

```sh
Graces-MacBook-Pro:~ grace$ mkdir wdi
Graces-MacBook-Pro:~ grace$ cd wdi
Graces-MacBook-Pro:wdi grace$ pwd
/Users/grace/wdi
Graces-MacBook-Pro:wdi grace$ mkdir try
Graces-MacBook-Pro:wdi grace$ cd try
Graces-MacBook-Pro:try grace$
```

What is the full path to the current directory?

## Question 2

Describe GitHub, **briefly** in your own words.

Github is a repository to save your projects, share your code, etc..
## Question 3

```js
(false || true) && (false && true);
```

Is the value of this expression `true` or `false`?  Explain your answer.

false. false || true is true. false && true is false. true && false = false.

## Question 4

```js
var x = 1;
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + x;
}
```

How many times does the loop run?  What's the value of `x` after the while loop?

x = 8. loop runs 3 times for values of x = 1, 2 and 4.
## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

result = 5. since a and b are not > 0, it returns a - b, in this case 0 - (-5) = 5.

## Question 6

```js
var groceryList = [
  'a loaf a bread',
  'a container of milk',
  'a stick of butter',
];
```

What is the value of `groceryList[2]`?

What is the value of `teamMember['hobby']`?  exercise `teamMember['name']`?  Jason Weeks
`teamMember['name']['surname']`? Weeks
