## Question 2

Describe GitHub, **briefly** in your own words.

Github is an extension of Git that allows developers to share their code by
publishing it to the repo to track changes and allow other developers to comment
on their code.

## Question 3

```js
(false || true) && (false && true);
```

Is the value of this expression `true` or `false`?  Explain your answer.

False. Since both expressions in parentheses do not equal each other, this is
false.

## Question 4

```js
var x = 1;
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + x;
}
```

How many times does the loop run?  What's the value of `x` after the while loop?

x = 8 after looping 3 times

## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

What is the value of result?  Explain your answer.

Answer = 5  The function is stating that if a or b is greater than zero, then
add the values of a and b, otherwise subtract the values. Since both values are
not greater than zero, the are subtracted.

## Question 6

```js
var groceryList = [
  'a loaf a bread',

];
```

What is the value of `groceryList[2]`?
