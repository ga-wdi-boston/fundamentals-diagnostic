Graces-MacBook-Pro:wdi grace$ pwd

## Question 2

Describe GitHub, **briefly** in your own words.

GitHub is a library where you can see/store projects. You can even clone other projects and try to improve on them. A useful part of GitHub is that when you commit changes you can see where you added or removed things or "Tracking changes".

## Question 3

```js
(false || true) && (false && true);
```

Is the value of this expression `true` or `false`?  Explain your answer.

the value is false because when you use && to compare them, they both have to be true to give you a "true" result.

## Question 4

```js
var x = 1;
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + x;
}
```

How many times does the loop run?  What's the value of `x` after the while loop?

the loop will run 3 times. the value will be 8.

## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

What is the value of result?  Explain your answer.

the result will be 5, the return a+b does not go through because neither is greater than 0.

## Question 6

```js
var groceryList = [
  'a loaf a bread',
  'a container of milk',
  'a stick of butter',
];
```

What is the value of `groceryList[2]`?

the value of groceryList[2] is 'a stick of butter'.

## Question 7

```js
var teamMember = {
  role: 'consultant',
  name: {
    given: 'Jason',
    surname: 'Weeks'
  },
  hobby: 'exercise'
};
```

What is the value of `teamMember['hobby']`?  Of `teamMember['name']`?  Of
`teamMember['name']['surname']`?

the value of teamMember['hobby'] is 'exercise' and the value of teamMember['name'] is 'Jason','Weeks'.
