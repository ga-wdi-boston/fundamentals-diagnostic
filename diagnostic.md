## Question 2

Describe GitHub, **briefly** in your own words.

GitHub is a cloud repository for storing and retreiving files. It also keeps track of the date timestamps to ensure been able to version the code in case you need to retrieve it again. Like a CVS system.

## Question 3

```js
(false || true) && (false && true);
```

Is the value of this expression `true` or `false`?  Explain your answer.

False as you cannot have an expression that is false and true at same time.

## Question 4

```js
var x = 1;
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + x;
}
```

How many times does the loop run?  What's the value of `x` after the while loop?

4 times.
x=5

## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

What is the value of result?  Explain your answer.

result = 5. It does not take the if branch because 0 is not greater than 0 or -5 is not greater than 0.

## Question 6

```js
var groceryList = [
  'a loaf a bread',
  'a container of milk',
  'a stick of butter',
];
```

What is the value of `groceryList[2]`?

a stick of butter

## Question 7

```js
var teamMember = {
  role: 'consultant',
  name: {
    given: 'Jason',
    surname: 'Weeks'
  },
  hobby: 'exercise'
};
```

What is the value of `teamMember['hobby']`?   = exercise
`teamMember['name']`?  =
given: "Jason"
surname: "Weeks"
teamMember['name']['surname']`? = Weeks
