## Question 2

Describe GitHub, **briefly** in your own words

GitHub is an open source program for helping track changes in projects and files, allowing programmers to work collaboratively, publicly or privately, etc.

## Question 3

```js
(false || true) && (false && true);
```

Is the value of this expression `true` or `false`?  Explain your answer.

(false || true) equates to 'true',
(false && true) equates to 'false',
true && false equates to 'false' - final value is 'false.'

## Question 4

```js
var x = 1;
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + x;
}
```

How many times does the loop run?  What's the value of `x` after the while loop?

The loop runs 4 times, with 4 being the value of 'x' after the while loop.

## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

What is the value of result?  Explain your answer.

returns a - b
0 - -5 = 5

## Question 6

```js
var groceryList = [
  'a loaf a bread',
  'a container of milk',
  'a stick of butter',
];
```

What is the value of `groceryList[2]`?

## Question 7

```js
var teamMember = {
  role: 'consultant',
  name: {
    given: 'Jason',
    surname: 'Weeks'
  },
  hobby: 'exercise'
};
```

What is the value of `teamMember['hobby']`?  Of `teamMember['name']`?  Of
`teamMember['name']['surname']`?

No idea ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
