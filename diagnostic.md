## Question 1

```sh
Graces-MacBook-Pro:~ grace$ mkdir wdi
Graces-MacBook-Pro:~ grace$ cd wdi
Graces-MacBook-Pro:wdi grace$ pwd
/Users/grace/wdi
Graces-MacBook-Pro:wdi grace$ mkdir try
Graces-MacBook-Pro:wdi grace$ cd try

## Question 2

Describe GitHub, **briefly** in your own words.

GitHub is a source control application where developers can check in code to a shared enviornment(s).

## Question 3

```js

(false || true) && (false && true);
```

Is the value of this expression `true` or `false`?  Explain your answer.
False
(false or true) and (false and true)
 The && checks to make sure both values are identical in type and value

## Question 4

```js
var x = 1;
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + x;
}
```

How many times does the loop run?  What's the value of `x` after the while loop?

The loop will run three time.
The value of x will be 8 after the last run.

## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

What is the value of result?  Explain your answer.

The answer will be 0 - -5 = 5
The starting value of a is equal to, not greater than 0 and the starting value of b is less than, not greater than 0, so the second return statement will be returned.

## Question 6

```js
var groceryList = [
  'a loaf a bread',

What is the value of `groceryList[2]`?

What is the value of `teamMember['hobby']`?  Of `teamMember['name']`?  Of
`teamMember['name']['surname']`?
