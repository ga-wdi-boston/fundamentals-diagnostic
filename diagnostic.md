## Question 2

Describe GitHub, **briefly** in your own words.

Github is a site that stores code and allows teams to collaborate by providing tools to help manage the contributing to the code's timeline.

## Question 3

```js
(false || true) && (false && true);
```

Is the value of this expression `true` or `false`?  Explain your answer.

'false'
false or true is a truthy statement but false and true is falsey, therefore false AND true is false.

## Question 4

```js
var x = 1;
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + x;
}
```

How many times does the loop run?  What's the value of `x` after the while loop?

3 times, the value of x after the while loop in the last iteration will be 8.

## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

What is the value of result?  Explain your answer.

-5, neither a or b agrees with the if statement, there for return is 0 - (-5)

## Question 6

```js
var groceryList = [
  'a loaf a bread',
  'a container of milk',
  'a stick of butter',
];
```

What is the value of `groceryList[2]`?
