A web based database of git repositories available to push and pull from in order to track work flow among projects.

## Question 3

```js

False

## Question 4

```js
var x = 1;
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + x;
}
```

How many times does the loop run?  What's the value of `x` after the while loop?

It runs 3 times. After the while loop: x = 8.

## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function strangeAdd(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

What is the value of result?  Explain your answer.

5.  The first if statement is false therefore we go with the second return value in the if else statement. 0 - (-5) = 5.

## Question 6

};
```

What is the value of `teamMember['hobby']`?  Of `teamMember['name']`?  Of `teamMember['name']['surname']`?

teamMember['hobby'] = 'exercise'  teamMember['name'] = [given: 'Jason', surname: 'Weeks']  teamMember['name']['surname'] = 'Weeks'
