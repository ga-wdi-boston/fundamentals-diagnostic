## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

What is the value of result?  Explain your answer.

The valeu of the result is false. In the original if statement one of the values
is less than 0 to force the second statement to run which gave us the result of
0 and -5
