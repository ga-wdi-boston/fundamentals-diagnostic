Graces-MacBook-Pro:~ grace$ cd wdi
Graces-MacBook-Pro:wdi grace$ pwd

## Question 2

Describe GitHub, **briefly** in your own words.

_An online git host for the public, by the public (can also be private)._

## Question 3

```js
(false || true) && (false && true);
```

Is the value of this expression `true` or `false`?  Explain your answer.

_false because it would equal to (true) AND (false) which equals to false._

## Question 4

```js
var x = 1;
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + x;
}
```

How many times does the loop run?  What's the value of `x` after the while loop?

_Runs 4 times and X = 16_

## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

What is the value of result?  Explain your answer.

_Value would be -5 because: 0>0 is false AND -5>0 is flase, therefore it goes to return a-b (0 - -5 = -5)_

## Question 6

```js
var groceryList = [
  'a loaf a bread',
  'a container of milk',
  'a stick of butter',
];
```

What is the value of `groceryList[2]`?

};
```

What is the value of `teamMember['hobby']`?  Of `teamMember['name']`?  Of
`teamMember['name']['surname']`?

_teamMember['hobby'] = excercise_
_teamMember['name']` = give: 'Jason', surname: 'Weeks'_
_teamMember['name']['surname'] = Weeks_
