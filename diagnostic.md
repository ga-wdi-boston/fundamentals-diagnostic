## Question 3

```js
(false || true) && (false && true);
```

Is the value of this expression `true` or `false`?  Explain your answer.

False. First parentheses is false. Second is true. True && false=False.

## Question 4

```js
var x = 1;
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + x;
}
```

How many times does the loop run?  What's the value of `x` after the while loop?

Loop runs 3 times. x=8 after the while loop.

## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

What is the value of result?  Explain your answer.

0-(-5)=5; a=0, b=-5. In the function, a is not >0 and b is not >0 so we do a-b.

## Question 6

```js
